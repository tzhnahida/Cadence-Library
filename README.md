## Folder Descriptions

### 1. ComponentLibrary (OrCAD Management)
- Contains component libraries managed by OrCAD, including schematic symbols, footprints, pads, and vias.  
- Resources are accessible directly through OrCAD CIS or library management tools.

### 2. ComponentLibrary/allegro (OrCAD-linked Allegro Project)
- Contains Allegro project resources referenced by OrCAD to maintain consistency between OrCAD and Allegro designs.  
- Includes:
  - `devices`: Allegro device and footprint libraries  
  - `symbols`: Allegro schematic symbols  

### 3. Datasheet
- Contains datasheets for all components for easy reference of electrical parameters and package details.

### 4. Footprints / Pads / Vias
- PCB layout resources including footprints, pads, and vias to ensure consistency between schematic and PCB design.

### 5. Symbols
- Schematic symbols library usable in both OrCAD Capture and Allegro Schematic.

### 6. CIS Database Files
- `Components.mdb`: OrCAD CIS component database for managing component attributes and footprint mappings.  
- `TZH_ECAD_CIS_ACCESS_V1.DBC`: CIS database access file for OrCAD.  
- `DBCBAK`: Backup of the CIS database to prevent accidental data loss.

### 7. .gitignore
- Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

> **Note:**  
> The `OldLibrary` folder contains historical files and can be ignored.

## Automation Tool: LyncLibrarySynchronizer

The `LyncLibrarySynchronizer` directory contains an automated database synchronization tool designed to streamline the library creation process.

### AI Generation Statement
> **Notice:** The core logic, modular architecture, and Go-based implementation of this tool were collaboratively generated by **AI (Gemini/GPT)**. It leverages advanced Large Language Models to handle complex component parameter extraction.

### 1. Tool Overview
**LyncLibrarySynchronizer** is an automated assistant specifically built for OrCAD CIS. It features:
- **Web Scraping**: Retrieves real-time component details from **SZLCSC** (LCSC Electronics).
- **AI Processing**: Utilizes the **DeepSeek** model to parse unstructured technical data into structured database fields.
- **Database Integration**: Automatically populates the `Components.mdb` database with verified parameters.

### 2. Usage Instructions
1. **Build the Executable**: 
   Run `go build -o LyncLibrarySynchronizer.exe` within the project directory.
2. **Launch the Tool**:
   ```bash
   LyncLibrarySynchronizer.exe -config "./config.toml"
   ```
